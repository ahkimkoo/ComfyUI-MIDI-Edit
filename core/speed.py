"""Speed adjustment: duration scaling and f0 resampling.

Provides both the dict-level ``apply_speed`` (operates on the raw MIDI JSON
track dicts) and the ``apply_speed_change`` adapter (operates on parsed
``Track`` objects). Formatting helpers round durations to 2 decimals while
keeping the rounded total equal to the true total.
